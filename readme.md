This is a github repository for the series of videos that I'm doing on Youtube. You can [check those videos out on my Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/WatchandLearnTutorials)

If you want to grab the code used in previous tutorials you can just download .zip file for the current video. Or you can click on [releases link](https://github.com/ivandoric/building-sites-with-middleman/releases) and grab the code for the specific video.
